## [Project 1: FIFA 18 Best Eleven: Data Visualization with Tableau FIFA18数据看板](https://public.tableau.com/views/Fifa18_portfolio_project/FIFA18Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
As a die-hard soccer fan and a long-time FIFA player, I often google the best team and players to use before kicking off the weekedn tournament. Now, with the data that I found on Sofifa, I built a dashboard of my own for just that. Hope you enjoy using the project as much as I was building it.

作为一个狂热的足球爱好者以及长期的FIFA玩家，我经常在网上找关于好用的球员和球队来迎接周末和朋友们的联赛。现在，我透过网上的数据，建立了一个快速找寻这些信息的Tableau数据看板来满足这一需求。

## [Project 2: Classification Modeling with Wine Quality 红酒质量分类模型](https://github.com/thelinxie/wine_classification)
During my last semester at school, I explored my curiosity about wine by pursuing a WSET certificate as an extracurricular activity (and so glad I did!). Now it would be fun if I could combine my interest in wine and analytic skills into a fun project.

出于长期对红酒以及酒文化的好奇，我在读研究生的最后一个学期决定在课外学习WSET的课程，并顺利地获得了Level 2的证书。这个有趣的分类模型项目结合了我的兴趣以及分析能力，希望你从中也能学习到一瓶红酒优劣的标准是如何判断的。

* Methods 使用技巧: EDA 探索性数据分析, Decision Trees 决策树, Random Forest 随机森林
* Data Source 数据源: [Kaggle-Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
